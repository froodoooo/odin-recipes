# odin-recipes

The current project is to build a basic recipe website. 
The website will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes.
The website is going to look very basic, but will look better over time, especially
as I learn to use CSS.

This project allowed me to hone my newfound skills in html, as basic as they are so far. It allowed me to continue the practice of writing the boilerplate from scratch, link pages, create ordered and unordered lists, and link images.
